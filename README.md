We know that Sorting Algorithms are important as Searching can be achieved in log complexity using algorithms like Binary Search. The program made should read Strings, Integers and Floats from the text file and needs to Sort the Data Types using different Sorting Algorithms. The Sorting Algorithms should be made in 2 groups, one which takes O(N2) Complexity and the other O(NLogN) Complexity. Once both executes we will compare the complexities. The user is given a menu to choose which sorting algorithms he/she will input from the drop down.
Once the Sorting is achieved we should implement Searching algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search and Hash Search. Once the target is found we should compare the efficiencies.
